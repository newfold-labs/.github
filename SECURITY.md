# Security Policy

Newfold believes effective disclosure of security vulnerabilities requires mutual trust, respect, transparency and common good between Newfold and Security Researchers. Together, our vigilant expertise promotes the continued security and privacy of Newfold customers, products, and services.

Newfold accepts vulnerability reports from all sources such as independent security researchers, industry partners, vendors, customers and consultants. Newfold defines a security vulnerability as an unintended weakness or exposure that could be used to compromise the integrity, availability or confidentiality of our products and services.
